## Google Authorizer CLI

So simple, so cute UwU<br>
This is just a simple switch to *`console mode`*<br><br>

If you wondering how it works, here is your answer:

It is something that google authorizer uses, but on console.

You can use it for setting every 2fa where Google Authorizer is mentioned<br>
And.. ah the syntax is `gauth --key hereYourKey`<br>
In place of `hereYourKey` place your manual 2fa secret.
