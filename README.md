## Google Authorizer CLI

So simple, so cute UwU
This is just a simple switch to *`console mode`*

If you wondering how it works, here is your answer:
> It uses HMAC SHA-256 to generate 6 digit codes
It is something that google authorizer uses, but on console.

You can use it for setting every 2fa where Google Authorizer is mentioned
And.. ah the syntax is `gauth --key hereYourKey`
In place of `hereYourKey` place your manual 2fa secret.
